### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Satyam. I'm a Software Engineer from Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India.

I have little experience in big data, machine learning, and AI technologies, and I like working with user-focused software. I'm currently aiming to grow as a machine learning engineer.

I am currently studying AI based technologies.

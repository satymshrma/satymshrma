### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Satyam. (He/Him)
I'm a Software Engineer from Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India.

I have little experience in big data, machine learning, and AI technologies. 
I like working with user-focused software and aim to grow as a full-stack and machine-learning engineer.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning AI and web-based technologies.

I'm open to working remotely, or on-site if the location is in India.

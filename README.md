### Hi! 👋

I'm Satyam Sharma.
I'm a Software Engineer from Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India.

I like working with user-focused software and aim to grow as a full-stack developer and machine-learning engineer.

🌱 I am currently learning new AI and web-based technologies.

I'm open to work - remotely for anywhere in the world, or on-site/remotely in India.

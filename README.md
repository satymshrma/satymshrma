### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Satyam. I'm a Software Engineer from Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India.

I like to work with front end technologies. I like to work on software that directly interacts with the people using it.
I have a vested interest in UX/UI and am a hobby/novice/aspirant game dev.
I am currently studying web based technologies.

I also like anime, xainxia, to draw & make 3D models.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at [@satymshrma](https://t.me/satymshrma) on Telegram, or mail me at satyamsharma.geu@gmail.com

Below are my repositories. (They are a bit messy, and at some places a little incomplete. But I'm working on it, so just bear with me for the while. <3)
